    <h4>Cold macaroni salad meets chicken salad... good recipe for leftovers. If you want more flavor, add in your favorite fruit, veggie, or whatnotâ€”such as celery, grapes, or frozen green peas. Happy eating.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2 each skinless, boneless chicken breasts, diced </li>
        <li>4 cups elbow macaroni </li>
        <li>4 large eggs </li>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise, or more to taste </li>
        <li>4 teaspoons white sugar </li>
        <li>4 teaspoons white vinegar </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion salt </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard </li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add chicken; continue to boil until no longer pink in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes. Let sit until cool enough to handle, then dice into small bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>While chicken cooks, bring a second large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse under cool water.</li>
        <li>At the same time, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove eggs from hot water and hold under cold running water to cool. Peel and dice eggs.</li>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, onion salt, salt, mustard, and pepper together in a large bowl. Mix in diced eggs, pasta, and chicken, adding a little more mayonnaise if too dry. Chill for at lest 1 hour, or up to 8 hours or overnight before serving.</li>
    </ol>
